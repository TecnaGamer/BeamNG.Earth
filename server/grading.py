"""Ground graded under roads (docs/ROADMAP.md v1.6; docs/research/2026-10-11-official-road-study.md §3, §5.3):
the physics block and the near mesh tiles sample one graded elevation, so tyres, DecalRoads and the
visible ground agree.

Per road (roads.road_specs; bridges, tunnels and off-ground segments are left out by it):
- along: the centreline height is the DEM sampled every PROFILE_STEP m and smoothed (Gaussian,
  SIGMA_M m; dirt roads DIRT_SIGMA_M), so grades stay real and small bumps go (the official maps:
  |2nd difference| per 10 m 0.02-0.1 m);
- across: flat over the core (the carriageway as a city street would have it, parking included, plus
  SHOULDER_M, or the sidewalk plus SIDEWALK_MARGIN_M on the classes that get sidewalks in towns, so a
  raised sidewalk slab sits on flat ground), then back to the natural ground over a transition of 2x the height difference (a
  1:2 cut or fill slope), clamped to [T_MIN, T_MAX] m;
- several roads at one point (junctions, divided carriageways) blend their targets by inverse distance
  from each centreline (BLEND_R), so they meet in a gradual slope.
The core width never depends on the land cover (it is taken as urban for every built road), and
each map cell's plan is made once per anchor and cached, so the block and the tiles built later from
the same anchor always agree.

GradedDem(dem, grader) is a drop-in for dem.Dem where only sample() is graded; use it for the block
and the levels <= 0 tiles only (coarser tiles sink under the block and cover far more ground).
